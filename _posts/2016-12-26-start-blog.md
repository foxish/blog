title: First Post (again)!
---

Hello world. I have wanted to write for a long time now and never before gotten around to doing it regularly. There are many unfinished snippets of my "blog posts" all over the internet, some from as far back as 2009.

Many false starts behind me, this holiday season 2016 seems like the perfect time to restart my efforts and follow through. I've been spending my time studying academic publications in the distributed systems domain this past week and came upon a realization. I realized that while it is true that my research of the existing knowledge base is leading to a better understanding of the domain for me, knowledge not shared is knowledge wasted. This is analogous to the "[if a tree falls in a forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)" argument. Knowledge gained in isolation dies with the "holder" of that knowledge. This is not bad in itself, as long as the knowledge gained helps the "holder" create value in some way. However, given the unpredictabilty of human lifespans, I think it makes little sense not to immediately put knowledge or understanding to use, in explaining to others who may be able to make use of it. 

I plan on writing often about topics that I understand well, disseminate knowledge and learn as well in the process. I strongly believe that making an effort to convey thoughts in as expository a manner as possible will be appreciated and put to good use by me or other beings, sooner or later. 
 
One of the reasons I'm optimistic about writing this time around is Jekyll which
seems to offer pain-free publishing and github integration. This should help focus on the content itself, rather than other aspects like style and formatting on a web page (urgh!).
 
Cheers.
