### More Information

I'm a Software Engineer in distributed systems at Google since May 2016. 
I work on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) with a focus on batch processing and distributed databases. 
Prior to this, I was a Master's student in the Computer Science department at Texas A&M University. 
My interests lie in distributed systems and programming languages.
